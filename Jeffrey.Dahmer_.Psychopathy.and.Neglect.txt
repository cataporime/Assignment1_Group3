Abstract
It is the intent of this paper to examine the relationship between Jeffrey Dahmer's

Childhood neglect, his fascination with death, and its later influence on his adult psychopathic
behavior. After defining the nature of serial killers and the impact of childhood abuse combined
with a fascination with death, the focus of this case study will shift to the long term impact ofthe
abuse and neglect suffered by American serial killer, Jeffrey Dahmer. Using the social learning
theory, the author will examine how this neglect and abuse tie into his later life as a sexual serial
killer. Additionally, the theories proposed by the author will be analyzed by professionals in the
field of childhood development.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Throughout history, people around the world have been captivated by the topic of serial
murderers, primarily because they cmmot understand why an individual would be willing to take
not only one life but multiple. Numerous sociologists and criminologists have dedicated their
entire lives to the research of individuals who prey upon other human beings. As a result, there is
never a shortage of information about what makes a serial killer and even how that serial killer
grew up. With an estimated 500 serial killers living and working in unsuspecting communities,
understanding the origins andlor causes for their anti-social and psychopathic tendencies is of the
utmost interest and importance to researchers and law enforcement officials (Federal Bureau of
Investigation, 2005). Statistically, these sadistic individuals are believed to be responsible for
3500 to 5000 murders every year (Victims of Violence, 201Ib). Current research on individuals
with anti-social and psychopathic tendencies has revealed copious amounts of information on the
serial murderer's psyche, biological development, and environmental development; very little
research has focused on the elements of a serial murderer's youth, which may have played a
crucial part in violent behavior later in life. In this exploratory case study, the author will focus
on the American serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, tracing the source of his psychopathic tendencies
back to his childhood neglect and resulting emotional abuse, his fascination with death, and
discussing how this may have influenced his opinion of the value of his own life in comparison
to the value of the lives of his seventeen young victims.

Description of a Serial Killer
Criteria to Define Serial Killers. There are three different types of individuals who kill
multiple victims: mass murderers, spree killers, and serial killers. According to the Federal
Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI) (2005), these individuals differ based on the number of victims,
motivation, and time between kills. A mass murderer is defined as an individual with four or
more kills occurring at one time with no discernible cooling down period in between the murders
(Federal Bureau ofInvestigation, 2005). In order to be classified as a spree killer, an individual
would need to kill two or more individuals with no cool down period between murders (Federal
Bureau ofInvestigation, 2005). Defining a serial killer, however, has proven to be more of a
challenge. In the past, the number of murders needed to qualify as a serial killer has ranged from
two to ten murders, occurring in multiple locations, and with a cooling down period between
murders (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2005). Currently, law enforcement has made the
decision to keep the number of murders on the low end, two or more victims, so that law
enforcement is able to respond quicker to potential serial murder investigations (Federal Bureau
of Investigation, 2005). Additional criteria for serial killers include the serial killer being a
stranger to the victim while also having no potential for financial gain as the crimes are generally
psychologically motivated (LaBrode, 2007). While the victims are generally random, they may
still have a symbolic meaning to the killer. For example, John Wayne Gacy Jr. killed "worthless
little queers and punks" (LaBrode, 2007, p. 154) because his own father was highly homophobic
and expressed that homophobia by being physically and verbally abusive toward him; due to
John Wayne Gacy J1'.'S close attachment to his mother and sister, his father saw him as a
homosexual and frequently called him a "manmla's boy" and a "little sissy" (Bell and Bardsley,
N.D., p. 1).

Serial Killer Traits. Contrary to popular belief, not all serial killers are white males. The
Federal Bureau of Investigation has made it a point to announce that serial killers come from all
ages, races, genders, and socioeconomic statuses (Federal bureau ofInvestigation, 2005).
However, an average serial killer profile states that serial killers are generally, but not always, a
"white male, low-middle socioeconomic status, in his 20s or 30s, has a history of childhood
abuse or neglect, is sociopathic [and/or] psychopathic, is a chameleon to his enviromnent, and
appears normal to others" (LaBrode, 2007, p. 154). While these two statements may appear
contradictory, they are in fact quite accurate; serial killers come young and old, male and female,
and classified from all different races. In 2007, an eight year old Indian boy, Amardeep Sada,
became the youngest serial killer in the world after strangling three infants over the course of a
year (Foster, 2007). One final characteristic that many serial killers tend to have in common is
the sexual gratification they receive by taking the life of another human being. Also known as
sexual sadists, these individuals incorporate their deviant sexual fantasies into their killings
(LaBrode, 2007).
Typology of Serial Killers. There are many different forms in which a serial killer may
manifest, and the two main groups are described as organized and disorganized (Victims of
Violence, 20 11 b). Organized killers will be highly methodical, planning every nuance of a
murder in advance and even stalking their victims until they have fully planned the entire crime,
including the escape (Victims of Violence, 2011 b). Organized killers will be very intelligent,
methodical, and social, will likely be married with children, will come across as channing and
successful, and will bring their own vehicle and weapon when they commit a murder (Victims of
Violence, 2007). Organized killers will watch the media coverage of the crimes and will only be
harder to capture the longer they continue to be free (Victims of Violence, 20 11 b).

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

Where organized killers are neat and clean, disorganized killers will be impulsive and
will make things up as they go (Victims of Violence, 20 11 b). Unlike the organized killers,
disorganized killers generally do not have a personal mode of transportation and will typically
kill near where they live (Victims of Violence, 2011b). They may be socially awkward and either
unemployed or employed with a low skilled job (Victims of Violence, 2011b). Often times,
serial killers will take a 'trophy' from their victims. With an organized killer, this is going to be
something long term and clean, like jewelry. A disorganized killer is prone to 'overkill' and will
often take a body part as a trophy (Victims of Violence, 2011b).
In addition to organized and disorganized killers, law enforcement can further categorize
a serial killer by classifying one as either a visionary killer, a mission oriented killer, a powercontrol killer, or a hedonistic killer (Victims of Violence, 2011 b). Hedonistic killers are
individuals who are usually schizophrenic and believe they are being 'told' to kill by an outside
force. Mission oriented killers are individuals who believe it is their responsibility to rid the
world of certain types of people, such as prostitutes, gays, or a certain race (Victims of Violence,
2011 b). Power-control killers are often individuals who feel they lack or have lacked power or
authority at one point in their lives. These individuals will kill in a manner that gives them the
ultimate power: the power over life or death (Victims of Violence, 2011b).
The hedonistic killer is the most common form of serial killer and is further classified as
a comfort, lust, or thrill killer (Victims of Violence, 2011b). A comfort killer will usually kill for
some form of momentary gain or other benefit that will provide some form of comfort (Victims
of Violence, 2011 b). An example would be a homeless person who kills other homeless
individuals in order to obtain the victims' belongings or a wanner location to live. A lust killer is
a sexual predator whose sexual gratification is increased based on the amount of pain andlor

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

mutilation inflicted upon the victims. Jeffrey Dahmer was the perfect example of this type of
serial killer since the mutilation of his victims would continue long after they died. The final
category of hedonistic killer is known as a thrill killer. This hedonistic killer thrives on fear and
death (Victims of Violence, 2011 b). An example would be an individual who stalks his or her
victims and sends threatening messages prior to killing his or her victims.

Description of Childhood Abuse
Throughout the years, there have been countless studies conducted on child neglect
and/or abuse and its long term impact on social, emotional, and even physical development in
adolescents. A common conclusion found in many of these studies reveals adolescents who have
grown up witnessing violence in their homes and/or in their cOlmnunities have a higher
likelihood of suffering from long term emotional, physical, and mental trauma. These children
will also suffer with difficulties associated with "attachment, regressive behavior, anxiety and
depression, and aggression and conduct problems. [Additionally, victims of abuse] may be more
prone to dating violence, delinquency, further victimization, and involvement with the child
welfare and juvenile justice systems" (Finkelhor, Turner, Ormrod, Hamby, and Kracke, 2009).
Overall, children who witness violence at a young age become desensitized to the violence and
many times will integrate this behavior into their own attitudes when relating to others.
Abuse comes in many shapes and forms affecting individuals from all races, ages,
socioeconomic statuses, religious backgrounds, and sexual orientations (Alabama Coalition
against Domestic Violence, 2010). Children who are abused will typically encounter the abuse
from members of their own family or from individuals who are very close to the family. This
form of abuse is generally defined as any form of assault, intimidation, battery, sexual assault, or
any criminal offense committed by a relative or person(s) living in the same house as the victim

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

6

which has caused the victim harm (Batiol & Bartol, 2011). Abuse often becomes evident in the
adolescent years of many serial murderers, and like many other victims of abuse, they will
continue this cycle of violence. The term "cycle of violence" is used in cases of abuse as a way
to explain the continuous cycle of violence that is commonly found in the family history of the
abused and the abuser (Finkelhor et a!., 2009). Although abuse and serial murder are two
different acts, research has shown that serial killers will often look for certain characteristics in
their victims. The characteristics can be race, sex, color and length of hair, job occupation, sexual
orientation, height, weight, and/or age (National Museum of Crime and Punishment, 2008).
Often times, the victim choice will in turn be based on the serial killer's experiences with abuse
as a child, and the characteristics of the abuser or perceived wrongdoer in the serial killer's past
will become the same characteristics that the serial killer seeks in the present when determining
the next victim.

Types of Abuse. Child abuse is defined as "any act or series of acts of commission or
omission by a parent 01' other caregiver (e.g., clergy, coach, teacher) that results in harm,
potential for hat'111, or threat ofhann to a child" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2012, p. 1). While a few of those children who experienced abuse as a child may grow up to be
serial killers, for the most part, abused children do not develop this extreme response to
childhood abuse. However, some do, and it is for this reason one must understand the types of
childhood abuse and how each form of abuse may physically, emotionally, and psychologically
traumatize a child for the rest of his or her life.
The first form of child abuse discussed in this analysis is physical abuse in which force is
deliberately used "against a child in such a way that the child is either injured or is at risk of
being injured" (Victims of Violence, 2011a, p. I). In situations of physical abuse, the child may

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

7

be subjected to beating, hitting, shaking, pushing, choking, biting, burning, kicking, being held
under water, or genital mutilation (Victims of Violence, 201Ia). The long term effects of being
physically abused as a child depend on the severity of the abuse, the ability of the child to cope
with the abuse, the availability of a support system for the child to turn to for support or help,
and several other factors. Children who are physically abused are more likely to encounter
physical, psychological, behavioral, academic, sexual, interpersonal, self-perception, andlor
spiritual consequences as a result of childhood abuse.
Sexual abuse is defined by the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act as the
"employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion" of an underage child to
engage in or assist in any sexually explicit or inappropriate act or simulation of an act, or the
"rape, statutory rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of children,
or incest with children" (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2008b, p. I). Sexually abused
children suffer many ofthe same long term consequences as physically abused individuals
including low self-esteem, depression, and relationship difficulties (Child Welfare Information
Gateway, 2008a).
Childhood neglect is defined as "the failure of a parent, guardian, or other caregiver to
provide for a child's basic needs" which may consist of physical, medical education, and/or
emotional needs (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2008b, p. 1). Neglect ofa child at a
young age is especially traumatic to psychological development as a child needs human
interaction in order to develop healthy social skills. A child who is neglected at a young age is
also at an increased risk for anti-social traits, borderline personality disorders, and violent
behavior as he or she gets older (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2008a; Finkelhor et aI.,
2009).

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

Emotional abuse is defined as a "pattern of behavior that impairs a child's emotional
development or sense of self-worth" and is one of the hardest forms of abuse to prove as it is
almost always combined with another form of abuse (Child Welfare Information Gateway,
2008b, p. 1). Since emotional abuse is generally found along with other forms of abuse, the long
term consequences for this form of abuse are the same as physical abuse, sexual abuse, and
neglect. Emotionally abused victims tend to see themselves as having less value due to their
abuse and are more prone to developing low self-esteem, depression, suicidal thoughts, anger,
and many additional psychological consequences.
Psychological Impact of Abuse. Individuals who have experienced neglect and/or abuse
tend to employ different methods for handling the abuse. While depression, suicidal thoughts,
anti-social disorders, and many other forms of psychological consequences exist for the victims
of neglect andlor abuse, research has discovered additional roles which may lead to further risks
associated with the previously mentioned forms of abuse. Gender is one such risk. According to
research funded by the Canadian Department of Justice and conducted by the Victims of
Violence (20 11 a) organization, female victims "tend to internalize, and are more prone to low
self esteem, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders, or other psychological disorders. Boys, on the
other hand, are more likely to externalize [their abuse] by becoming more aggressive and violent
toward others" (Victims of Violence, 2011a, p. 1). This research was also confirmed in research
studies by the Child Welfare Information Gateway (2008a) and by researchers Finkelhor et a!.
(2009) and Baldry (2003).
Jeffl'ey Dahmer's Childhood
One male child who showed aggressive and violent tendencies as he matured was JeftJ'ey
Dahmer. Having grown up in a family who outwardly appeared to be loving and perfectly

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

normal, Jeffi'ey Dahmer's childhood differs from the childhood of many serial killers. Although
interviews with Dahmer's family tell ofa happy young boy who loved animals and nature, his
family also speaks of an unexplainable darkness that crept into their little boy (Dahmer, 1994).
His father, Lionel Dahmer (1994), would later write a book titled A Father's StD/Y. His book
explores the nightmare he endured while raising a little boy the best he could and simultaneously
finding his every attempt to raise young Jeffrey Dahmer ending in failure. "It is a pOlirayal of
parental dread ... the terrible sense that your child has slipped beyond your grasp, that your little
boy is spimling in the void, swirling in the maelstrom, lost, lost, lost (Dahmer, 1994, p. 14)."
Lionel Dalllller does explain that there were several family issues that may have inevitably
harmed Jeffrey Dahmer in a psychological nmmer. Jeffrey Dahmer faced many potentially
traumatizing situations as a child. One of these was his surgery for a double hemia when he was
approximately four years old. Jeffrey Dahmer was terrified his penis had been cut off
(Dalnnervideos, 2012f). Lionel Daimler claims Freudian psychology would argue that this
perceived castration may have been what led him to cut off the penises of his later victims
(Dahmervideos, 2012f). Throughout Jeffrey Dahmer's childhood, he frequently witnessed his
mother under the effects of her anti-anxiety drug, Equanil. Additionally, both of his parents were
more involved in their own lives and generally left him to fend for himself, and he witnessed
countless verbal altercations between his parents which would eventually lead to his parents'
divorce when he was eighteen (Dalnner, 1994). Additional research into the divorce of Jeffrey
Dahmer's parents also explores the possibility that Jeffrey Dahmer may have developed
abandonment issues when he found that he could no longer contact his mother and little brother
after his parents' divorce. Lack of contact with his mother and little brother coupled with the fact
that his father spent large amounts of time working on his PhD at Iowa State University, rather

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

10

than at home in order to avoid family turmoil, may have compounded Dahmer's feelings of
isolation and abandonment.
Jeffrey Dahmer's experience with neglect may not have been the only negative factor in
his childhood; there were also unsubstantiated rumors that he may have suffered sexual abuse
from a peer in his neighborhood. The rumors of Jeffrey Dahmer being molested by a
neighborhood boy when he was eight were never confirmed and were even adamantly denied by
Jeffrey Dalnner's father (Dahmervideos, 2012). If the alleged sexual assault actually occurred, it
could explain why he would have chosen to target young boys and men to rape, torture, and kill.
On the other hand, Jeffrey Dalnner's choice of victims could also be nothing more than the
actions of a sexually confused young man who was terrified of being left alone or abandoned.
Jeffrey Dahmer would later confess that the cannibalism made him feel like his victims were a
permanent pati of him. (Dalnnervideos, 2012b).
In 1994, Stone Phillips interviewed Jeffrey Dahmer and his family in a very candid
interview. During this interview, Jeffrey Dahmer and his parents all agreed that he was a normal
little boy, just a little quiet. Jeffrey Dalnner's mother, Joyce Flint, smiles as she recalls her oldest
son, referring to Jeffrey Dalnner as a wonderful and fun little boy who would join her in doing
"all the things normal people do" (Joyce, 2012 c, 4:04). Joyce Flint further states that she never
saw any warning signs and claims she would have gotten him help if she had ever noticed
anything out of the ordinary (Dahmervideos, 2012e). Whether or not Joyce Flint and Lionel
Dalnner were truly oblivious to Jeffrey Dahmer's behavior may never be fully known, but what
camlOt be denied is the abuse and neglect which Jeffrey Dalnner experienced as a child. Combine
this with witnessing multiple heated arguments and rumors of physical altercations between

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

Joyce Flint and Lionel Dahmer, and a very grim picture is painted of the home in which Jeffi'ey
Dahmer was raised.
Exposure to Abuse andlor Violence. Jeffrey Dahmer never experienced physical abuse,
and the sexual abuse he was rumored to have experienced was never substantiated, implying that
the neglect and subsequent emotional abuse were the primary influencing factors for Jeffrey
Dahmer's later murders. There have been countless studies showing how detrimental early
childhood abuse can be on a child's development and how it may lead to anti-social behavior,
increased violence, and numerous additional symptoms (Kotch et aI., 2008; Victims of Violence,
2011 a; Victims of Violence, 2011 b; Trickett, Negriff, Ji, & Peckins, 2011). In Jeffrey Dahmer's
life, these symptoms became evident as Jeffrey Da111ner withdrew from others and instead chose
to internalize his feelings of frustration rather than seek help for the increasingly disturbing
thoughts which manifested in his mind.
In the 1994 Stone Phillips interview, Jeffrey Dahmer confessed that he had never had a
real deep conversation with his father, Lionel Dahmer; conversations he did have with his father
were always superficial (Dahmervideos, 2012b). Lionel Daillner, himself, admitted that he
learned everything about his son's state of mind during the trial and in Jeffrey Dahmer's
confessions (Dalunervideos, 2012b). Joyce Flint also appeared to be caught off guard by her
son's actions, claiming she never saw the warning signs and was never even informed of the
issues with her son until news of his arrest and crimes began playing in the media
(Dahmervideos,2012e).
Interpersonal violence was another matter that neither of Jeffrey Dahmer's parents found
to be a serious issue when raising Jeffrey Dal11l1er or his younger brother. Joyce Flint claimed it
was something she grew up with and therefore saw nothing wrong with it (Dahmervideos,

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

12

2012f). This reaction to interpersonal violent exposure is often how individuals in violent homes
view violence; since they experienced it as a child, it must be normal or have little or no impact
on children who reside within the home. This is a phenomenon which has been analyzed in
multiple research stndies, and in nearly every case, violent exposure has been shown to have a
significant impact on the child's psychological and social development (Sousa et a1., 2011;
Mustanoja et a1., 2011; Baldry, 2003).
Anti-social Behavior. As a child or adolescent, most individuals have skipped a class,

harassed a classmate or sibling, or uttered a swear word at a peer. Generally, if this individual is
caught, he or she will be reprimanded for the behavior and will think twice before committing
the offense again. However, for some individuals this is not the case. Children who continually
behave in a manner which is considered inappropriate or a blatant violation of another
individual's rights are diagnosed with conduct disorder. Conduct disorder is often found to
develop in children when they are in late childhood or early adolescence and will generally
consist of bullying, damaging propeliy, lying, and/or stealing without remorse (Johnston, 2009).
Where childhood misconduct will typically stop once the child is caught and reprimanded,
children with a conduct disorder are selfish, lack guilt, and generally do not get along well with
others, making it very difficult to treat the misconduct since they will not see their behavior as
wrong (Johnston, 2009). Due to this lack of guilt, these individuals are prone to violent and often
unprovoked aggressive behavior against other individuals and/or animals (Johnston, 2009). If
conduct disorder is not properly diagnosed and treated, with medication or by removing the child
from the problem enviromnent, the child is likely to begin displaying anti-social tendencies.
Anti-social behavior is characteristically defined as behavior in which an individual knowingly
violates an individual's rights aod/or the laws and standards of society in a maoner that is not

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

13

generally considered illegal (Bartol and Bartol, 2011). Anti-social behavior is officially defined
as a "mental health condition in which a person has a long-term pattern of manipulating,
exploiting, or violating the rights of others" (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2010, p. 1). Curt
Bartol and Anne Baliol (2011) asseli that the younger these actions develop, the more likely
these individuals are to engage in more serious behavior as they get older (Baliol and Bartol,
2011). "Seriously anti-social children are likely to progress in a spiral of escalating and more
severe anti-social and violent behavior over time" (Bartol and Bartol, 2011, p. 140).
For those unfortunate children who grow up with abuse and neglect, often times their
cries for help are overlooked or ignored. "If a conduct disorder pattern is present prior to the age
of fifteen, it is strongly associated with an increased risk of violent behavior into middle age
(Bartol and Bartol, 2011, p. 49)." Children whose cries for help are ignored or overlooked will
become involved in deviant behavior, and from there, they will gradually turn toward more
illegal and even deadly activities. This behavior was particulady evident with Jeffi'ey Dahmer.
At the age of four, Jeffrey Dahmer's Father had noticed Jeffrey Dahmer had a particularly odd
fascination with a pile of bones that had been raked out from under his childhood home. While
this odd behavior was noticed, Lionel Dahmer did nothing to deter his son's interest with death,
and as a result, his son's interest grew. By the time Jeffrey Dahmer was in his teens, his interest
in death had turned into an obsession. When he was in ninth grade, he was assigned a fetal pig
and told to dissect the animal as a part of his grade; he later took the animal home and kept the
skeleton (Dahmervideos, 2012a). This obsession eventually led to Jeffrey Dahmer frequently
riding his bike along roads, collecting the bodies of animals which had been hit by cars, and later
mutilating and displaying the bodies in a macabre maimer (Dahmer, 1994). Following his arrest,
Jeffrey Dahmer was asked why he continued to mutilate animals after he completed the first one;

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

14

his only response was that he did not know why. "It became a compulsion and it switched from
animals to humans. I still don't understand it. I don't know why" (Dahmervideos, 2012a, 6:50).
In the 1994 interview with Jeffrey Daimler and his parents, Jeffrey Dahmer appeared
calm, relaxed, and even pleasant when talking about the crimes he committed. While he
appeared to genuinely feel remorse for his actions, he did not feel that he could stop killing.
Jeffrey Dahmer even claims to not have any recollection of his second murder, which he
believed to be the murder which pushed him over the edge (Dahmervideos, 2012b). Jeffrey
Dahmer's Father, Lionel Dahmer, strongly believed that it was his own unacted upon desires that
were carried down into Jeffrey Dahmer; where Lionel Dahmer would fantasize about harming
people (the neighborhood bullies) in his dreams, Jeffrey Dahmer would act on these desires in
real life, beginning with animals and later with humans (Dahmervideos, 2012f). Lionel Dahmer
further stated that it may have been Jeffrey Dahmer's strong sexual drive which led him to
sexually assault, dismember, and cannibalize his victims (Dahmervideos, 2012f).
In interviews with Jeffrey Dahmer, he appeared just as perplexed by his actions as
everyone else, claiming the urge to kill was uncontrollable, unavoidable, and something he could
not understand. Jeffrey Daimler admitted he began having fantasies of death mingled with sex by
the time he was 14 or 15 years of age, and it was at that age that he felt he was at a point of no
return (Dalmlervideos, 2012a). Jeffrey Dahmer claimed his fantasies consisted of picking up a
hitchhiker, holding him hostage, and doing whatever he wanted with him (Dalmlervideos,
2012b). Tln'ee years later, all of the pieces fell together. One night, while driving home to a once
again empty home, Jeffrey Dahmer drove past a hitchhiker and was unable to stop himself. "All
the parts were there that just made it possible to happen" (Jeffrey, 2012b, 1:35). Steven Hicks
was only 19 years old when he was murdered.

Chaptel' Summary

Media sources, movies, books, and even television shows have managed to keep a deep
fascination with the concept of a serial murderer thriving year after year. Those who have taken
the time to research these disturbed individuals have classified the types of serial killers as either
organized or disorganized killers, allowing society to further define serial killers based on the
mmmer in which they kill. In addition to being either organized or disorganized, a serial killer
can be a visionary killer, a mission oriented killer, a power-control killer, or a hedonistic killer
(Victims of Violence, 2011b).
For those who wish to understand why a serial killer kills, research will generally lead
them to stories of childhood abuse or neglect as a precursor to violent andlor anti-social
tendencies. Many serial killers are exposed to some form of neglect, physical, sexual, and/or
emotional abuse as a child; however, Jeffrey Dahmer only experienced neglect and emotional
abuse as a child making his case rather unique. Jeffrey Dahmer began to display anti-social
behavior as a result of regular and long term neglect as a child. It is believed that this neglect is
what led Jeffrey Dahmer to devalue life and develop anti-social traits which would later develop
into full fledged psychopathic tendencies as he got older.

Review of Literature
Introduction
This chapter presents the current and/or influential research studies and data gathered on
childhood neglect/abuse and how that neglect/abuse later impacts on adult serial murder and/or
violent tendencies. Over the years, various research studies have been conducted to study the
phenomenon of neglect/abuse and its resulting effect on a child's social and psychological
development. The studies delve nlllher into how the child's development may influence his or
her adult behavior. By showing how neglect/abuse can influence a child's behavior and
personality, researchers have been able to more effectively solidify the comlection between
abuse/neglect and increased likelihood of anti-social behaviors, various personality disorders,
and increased criminal and/or deviant behavior.
The following reviews will summarize the pellinent literature relating to this analysis's
subject maMer; particular focus will be given to those studies which analyze the long term
impact of neglect and abuse on child development. Additional elements which will be reviewed
are: child/parent attachment, witnessing domestic violence as a child, anti-social behavior and
personality disorders, and studies relating to childhood abuse and animal torture and/or
mutilation. Specifically, this literature review chapter is arranged into five subcategories: (a)
social learning theory, (b) childhood abuse and neglect, (c) anti-social behavior, (d) violence
against animals, (e) serial murder and/or violence.
Data was obtained for this literature review using the Regis University online database
and various additional online databases for scholarly research. The primary databases used were:

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

17

Sage journals, Wiley Online Library, Google Scholar, and federally funded organizations for
both the United States and foreign governments. The most commonly used keywords or phrases
were: Jeffrey Dahmer, child abuse, child neglect, anti-social, psychopath, serial killer, social
learning theory, and many additional variations and/or combinations of each of those terms. In
the following literature review, miicles were chosen based on the quality of research, relation to
proposal topic, and readability.
Social Learning Theory

The social learning theory is the belief that an individual learns celiain behaviors from his
or her environment through observational learning (McLeod, 2011; Bandura, 1977). Heng Choon
(Oliver) Chan, Kathleen M. Heide, and Eric Beauregard (2011) used the social learning theory
and routine activities theory as the foundation for their research on sexual homicide. Through the
use of these two criminological theories, Chan et al. (2011) were able to research the motivation
process fi·om which an individual becomes "motivated to sexually kill, decides to sexually kill,
and acts of that desire, intention, and opportunity" (Chan et aI., 2011, p. 228). Their analysis of
sexual killings conclnded by stating that a sexual killer not only requires the correct state of mind
for the act but must also have the correct environmental cues for the crime to occur. Also known
as the routine activities theOlY, these environmental cues will generally consist of a "motivated
and potential offender, an attractive and suitable target, and an ineffective or absent capable
guardian protecting against a violation" (Chan et aI., 2011, p. 232). Chan et al. (2011) also
claimed that individuals who conmlit sexual killing are generally exposed to regnlar and long
tenn sexual violence and other criminal behavior starting from early childhood, usually from a
parent or caregiver. Jeffrey Dahmer was used to illustrate Chan et al.'s (2011) claims since he is
a well known American serial killer and because he witnessed multiple domestic disputes and

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

18

altercations between his parents. He was also chosen as an example due to his experiences with
parental neglect as a child and adolescent; as a result of that neglect, he was denied the childparents interaction he needed for proper social development. Additionally, Chan et al. (2011)
suggested communities combat the issue of child neglect by encouraging individuals to take part
in parenting classes, high schools to teach child development or parenting classes, and parental
support groups.
When defining the causality of psychopathic tendencies, there are numerous theories
which pertain to biological and environmental factors and their influence on the development of
psychopathic behavior. Using the Social Learning and Individual Trait Theories, Rebecca
LaBrode (2007) analyzed the lives of several different serial killers "to assess the similarities and
differences between their histories, crimes, and personalities" (LaBrode, 2007, p. 151) and found
a startling number of connections between the targeted serial killers. The targeted serial killers
were Gary Ridgeway, Ed Gein, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, BTK (Demlis Rader), John Wayne
Gacy Jr., and Ed Kemper. All of these individuals displayed anti-social personality disorder traits
as well as psychopathic tendencies and similarities in the crimes they committed, their
personalities, and their histories. "Gary Ridgeway (The Green River Killer), Jeffrey Dahmer, Ed
Kemper, and Henry Lee Lucas all engaged in necrophilia, which involves engaging in sexual
activity with deceased individuals" (LaBrode, 2007, p. 154). While they grew up in different
times, locations, and with different family upbringing, all of these individuals had a history of
"abuse, trauma, insecure attachment, loss or abandonment of a parent or caretaker, anti-social
behavior, head injury, and low arousal levels" (LaBrode, 2007, p. 154-155). Even the
victimology of these individuals shares a common theme as each chose a primary characteristic
that all their victims shared. For example Jeffrey Dahmer targeted young men, John Wayne Gacy

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

19

Jr. targeted adolescent boys, Ted Bundy targeted college aged women with long hair, and Gary
Ridgeway targeted prostitutes (LaBrode, 2007).
Following Labrode's (2007) analysis of common themes found amongst serial murderers,
Richard B. Felson and Kelsea Jo Lane (2009) conducted a research study which stated that
offenders will commit crimes based on what they have been exposed to. Using data gathered
from State and Federal Correctional Facilities, Felson and Lane (2009) came to the conclusion
that offenders who were exposed to sexual abuse as a child were more likely to commit sexual
crimes as an adult, patiicularly targeting young children as their victims, while physically abused
offenders were more likely to commit violent offenses (Felson & Lane, 2009). This data resulted
in Felson and Lane's (2009) encompassing question: "[W]hat exactly do children model when
they are mistreated" (Felson & Lane, 2009, p. 489)7 Bandura's (1977) social learning theory
claimed "behavior modeled is often the same as the behavior observed" (Felson & Lane, 2009, p.
489) which would imply mistreated children are more likely to transfer the violent treatment they
received as children to those they encounter when they reach adulthood (Bartol & Baliol, 2011;
Felson & Lane, 2009).

Childhood Abuse and Neglect
There are numerous methods for disciplining a child when he or she misbehaves, but
none quite as controversial as physically harming a child. While many parents who spank their
misbehaving child do so in a malmer which is more startling than harmful, even this can have
long term psychological impacts on a young child's development. Kathryn Maguire-Jack,
Andrea N. Gromoske, Lawrence M. Berger (2012) recently conducted a study which targeted
children under the age of five years in hopes of determining whether "spanking at ages 1 and 3 is
adversely associated with cognitive skills and behavior problems at ages 3 and 5" (Maguire-Jack

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

20

et ai., 2012, p. 1). Known as the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, their study worked
with 4,898 U.S. children born between 1998 and 2000. The majority of the children were fi'om
unmarried families with lower incomes (Maguire-Jack et ai., 2012). Data was obtained through
telephone or in-person interviews at the child's birth and then again when the child was within
the one, three, or five year age range (Maguire-Jack et ai., 2012). Spanking levels were recorded
by researchers who obtained the information purely by asking the mother of the targeted child to
rate how often she spanked her child, or how often her spouse/partner spanked the child, on a
five point scale (Maguire-Jack et ai., 2012). The scale ranged from: "[(1)] never in the past
month, [(2)] once or twice, [(3)] a few times this past month, [(4)] a few times a week, [(5)] or
every day or nearly every day" (Maguire-Jack et ai., 2012, p. 5).
While the amount of spanking was not recorded in a statistically reliable maimer, the
behavioral, cognitive, and emotionality problems were measured in a manner which was far
more reliable. Behavioral problems were measured by using the Child Behavior Checklist, which
compares how the child displays externalized and internalized behavior problems (Maguire-Jack
et ai., 2012). The child cognitive development was measured using the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test III which is frequently used to measure children's language and cognitive
abilities (Maguire-Jack et ai., 2012). The final test was only obtained from the children when
they were in the 1 year age group. This test measured each child's tendency to become easily
aroused, often intensely, which is frequently associated with later cognitive skills, behavior
problems, and consequentially an increased risk of parental stress and maternal spanking
(Maguire-Jack et ai., 2012). Using the Emotionality, Activity, and Sociability (EAS)
Temperament Survey for Children, Maguire-Jack et ai. (2012) were able to measure each child's
emotional development. Conclusions gathered from this study showed "spanking at age one was

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

21

associated with a higher level of spanking and externalizing behavior at age [three], and
spanking at age [three] was associated with a higher level of internalizing and externalizing
behavior at age [five]" (Maguire-Jack et aI., 2012, p. 1, 10-13). Additional conclusions showed
that a link "between spanking at age [one] and behavioral problems at age [five]" were often
signs the child was exposed to ongoing spankings from the age of one to the age of five
(Maguire-Jack et aI., 2012). The authors were not able to conclude that spanking a one year old
child had any effect on cognitive skills at either three or five years of age (Maguire-Jack et aI.,
2012).
Jonathan B. Kotch et al. (2008) all conducted an in-depth research study on early
childhood neglect (birth to two years of age) and the impact it had on later childhood aggression
(ages four, six, and eight). Using a study group made up of 1318 at risk children, Kotch et al.
(2008) gathered reports of aggressive behavior from the child's primary caregiver and repOlis of
child maltreatment from the Child Protective Service. Known as the LONGSCAN study, this
study made use of the Modified Maltreatment Classification Scheme (MMCS) in order to gather
a more accurate interpretation of neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional
maltreatment (Kotch et aI., 2008). According to MMCS, physical abuse is an intentional act of
hanning a child by a caregiver or responsible adult which physically injures the child; this does
not include ear piercing, circumcision, or any other form of culturally accepted physical harm
directed at a child (Kotch et aI., 2008). Sexual abuse is any intentional exposure, contact, or
interaction of a sexual nature between a child and a caregiver or responsible adult which results
in sexual gratification or monetary profit for the adult (Kotch et aI., 2008). Sexual abuse would
also include any and all injuries which were a direct result of the sexual act (Kotch et aI., 2008).
Physical neglect was defined in two different ways in the MMCS: first as failure to provide and

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

22

second as a lack of supervision. These two definitions are explained in a literal sense. A failure
to provide means caregivers or responsible adults who fail to meet the physical needs of the child
(Kotch et aI., 2008). The physical needs of the child include the requirement of adequate food
and shelter. Lack of supervision included parents and responsible adults who fail to adequately
supervise a child both inside and outside the home (Kotch et aI., 2008). Bringing a child into an
unsafe enviromnent, allowing a child to be supervised by an unsafe or unsuitable guardian, or
inadequate supervision of the child are all examples of the child having lack of supervision
(Kotch et aI., 2008). After reviewing the data obtained from the LONGS CAN study, Kotch et al.
(2008) were able to conclude that only early childhood neglect was a significant predictor of
higher aggression scores. Additionally, Kotch et al. (2008) were able to conclude that "early
abuse, later abuse, and later neglect were not significantly predictive" of future aggressive
behavior in children (p. 725).
Cindy Sousa et al. (2011) explored the effects of child abuse in combination with a child
witnessing his or her parents being domestically violent toward each other and compared this to
the likelihood of the same child developing anti-social tendencies as an adolescent. Data
gathered for this study was performed longitudinally over approximately 16 years on 457
children who were approximately four years of age during the first wave of the study,
approximately eight years of age during the second wave of the study, and approximately
eighteen years of age during the third wave of the study. Abuse was measured based on the
amount and degree of disciplinary action taken against a child, which included biting, slapping,
and hitting a child with a hard object (Sousa et aI., 2011). Domestic violence was measured by
recording the amount and degree of "physical violence (hit, punch, kick), threats to do physical
harm, and breaking things" (Sousa et aI., 2011, p. 119). Sousa et al. (2011) concluded from the

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

23

findings that a stronger parent -child attachment as well as reducing the likelihood of a child
witnessing domestic violence could reduce the risk of anti-social behavior as the child reaches
adolescence.
Children who witness domestic violence between their parents are not only at a higher
risk of developing anti-social behavior, (Souta et a!., 2011) but according to Susamm Mustanoja
et a!. (2011), these children are also increasingly vulnerable to bullying behavior, both as the
victim and the bully. As part of the STUDY -70 project, the research study "consisted of 508
(208,40.9% males; 300, 59.1% females) adolescent inpatients aged 12-17 years (mean 15.4
years; [standard deviation]!.3) consecutively admitted to Unit 70 at Ou1u University Hospital,
Department of Psychiatry, between April 2001 and March 2006" (Mustanoja et a!., 2011, p.
496). As a method for determining the amount oftrauma these adolescents had experienced, a
survey was taken from each individual asking if the adolescent had witnessed 01' been the victim
of a violent crime, witnessed domestic violence ("involving threatened 01' actual harm to parent"
(Mustanoja et a!., 2011, p. 497)), or been subjected to physical and/or sexual abuse both isolated
01' reoccurring. This information was compared to data gathered on the participant's experience

with bullying, which the researchers defined as threatening or intimidating behavior directed
toward another individual on three 01' more occasions (Mustanoja et a!., 2011). Mestanoja et a!.
(2011) concluded the study by revealing the increased likelihood of aggressive behavior, in the
form of bullying, for both boys and girls. Boys showed a statistically significant association
between bullying behavior and witnessed interpersonal violence between their parents; Girls
showed that their bullying behavior was significantly associated with "witnessing a violent
crime, to being a victim of violent crime, to witnessing [interpersonal violence between her
parents], and to physical abuse by [her] parents" (Mustanoja et a!., 2011, p. 498; Sousa et a!.,

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

24

2011; Kotch et aI., 2008; Maguire-Jack et aI., 2012; Bartol & Bartol, 2011; Felson & Lane, 2009;
LaBrode, 2007).
In 2011, researchers Penelope K. Trickett, Sonya Negriff, Juye Ji, and Melissa Peckins
conducted a survey on child abuse and neglect and the substantial effect this has on society. Over
the last several decades, there has been a great deal of research on child neglect and abuse and
each of these studies "indicate such maltreatment is associated with a number of mental health
problems, including internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as other maladaptive
developmental problems in childhood and beyond" (Trickett et aI., 2011, p. 3). After reviewing
these research studies, Trickette, et a1. (2011) were able to conclude that a significant number of
additional research studies need to be conducted on the societal impact of child abuse and
neglect. TIllS would be beneficial to communities since it would provide additional information
needed by child welfare and other similarly focused organizations in order to create intervention
programs which may be able to reduce the number of abused and/or neglected children in
society. Additionally, data resulting from the research by Trickette, et a1. (2011) found
intervention programs to be generally successful when treating abused or neglected children.
Anti-Social Behavio.·
Anti-social behavior is the intentionally destructive behavior which results in physical or
mental harm to an individual, property loss, and/or results in a significant impact on the physical
or mental well-being of another person (Sentse, Dijkstra, Lindenburg, Onnel, & Veenstra, 2010).
In the 2010 Dutch study, known as TRIALS, researchers were hoping to determine how much of
an impact parental protection and supervision has on the development and prevention of antisocial behavior in adolescents. The study group consisted of 1023 participants, with an average
age of 13.51 years, and primarily included young girls (55.5%) (Sentse et aI., 2010). TRIALS

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

25

researchers focused on two main questions in this study. The first pertained to the level at which
parents set rules, protected their children, and supervised their actions (Sentse et a!., 2010). By
asking this question, the researchers were able to compare overprotective and domineering
parents to the under supervised and laid back parents in order to determine which of these two
styles leads to a higher likelihood of anti-social behavior. The results of this question revealed
that both parenting styles could lead to children which anti-social tendencies (Sentse et a!.,
2010).
Adolescents with higher levels of maturity who were overprotected were not given the
chance to explore adult privileges, such as autonomy, and this restriction resulted in adolescents
engaging in more anti-social behavior as a way to asseli their independence. Adolescents whose
parents allowed them to be independent and self sufficient were also at a higher risk for antisocial behavior because they were allowed to roam the streets without supervision, and often
times, free-living adolescents tend to engage in anti-social behavior (pranks, theft, bullying ... ) or
develop friendships with other anti-social individuals in order to feel a sense of belonging
(Sentse et a!., 2010). The second research question in the TRIALS study asked whether antisocial behavior in adolescence is to some degree a result of miscommunication between over
protective parents and adolescents who make every effort to be independent and self sufficient
(Sentse et a!., 2010). This qnestion revealed adolescents who matured early or were male were
still at an increased risk. However, if the parents were willing to monitor their children without
blatantly monitoring their activities, they were able to reduce the children's likelihood for
developing anti-social behavior (Sentse et a!., 2010). Sentse et a!. (2010) measured anti-social
behavior through the use of an Anti-social Behavior Questionnaire to determine the level of antisocial behavior in the adolescent participant. The questionnaire also provided questions for

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

26

obtaining the number offriends which displayed mild to severe anti-social behavior, through the
participant's self admission. The parents' parenting style was obtained by administering the 'My
Memories of Upbringing for Children' questionnaire. TRIALS also obtained information on the
amount of unsupervised wandering, parental knowledge, and biological maturation of the
adolescent (Sentse et aI., 2010).
Childhood and adolescent neglect has long been known to be linked to the development
of aggressive and/or anti-social behavior. In John F. Knutson, David DeGarmo, Gina Koeppl,
and John B. Reid's (2005) study, they chose to explore how much of an impact one's parenting
style will have on this particular topic. Taking into account that many studies have failed to
directly connect childhood neglect to future aggressive or anti-social behavior, the authors' took
care to acknowledge that neglect is often associated with other forms of child maltreatment
andlor socioeconomic disadvantages (Knutson et aI., 2005). As a result, Knutson, et al. (2005)
concluded that their research study needs to make a special effolt to control or regulate the
elements of child maltreatment and socioeconomic disadvantages, in addition to providing "wellspecified operational definitions of neglect" (Knutson et aI., 2005, p. 93). In order to accurately
record the impact of "neglectful parenting, poor supervision, and puni tive parenting in the
development of children's aggression", 218 children ranging from 4 to 8 years of age were
selected from disadvantaged families across two different states: southeastern Iowa and north
central Wisconsin (Knutson et aI., 2005, p. 92). In an effort to ensure a diverse collection of
study participants, individuals were reclUited with particular focus on the degree of their
urbanization and ethnicity (Knutson et aI., 2005). Following an initial stlUctured interview and an
in-home assessment, a study that was used to obtain background information on the participants,
results were obtained purely from three laboratory sessions which were approximately 90

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

27

minutes apiece (Knutson et ai., 2005). The first of the three laboratory sessions was conducted
approximately 26 days after the initial interview and in-home assessments. This first part of the
session requested that the mothers of the children take a literacy test, known as the Reading and
Spelling subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test, followed by a recorded parent-child
interaction experiment (Knutson et ai., 2005).
The experiment section consisted of the child learning a new board game and later
teaching the rules to the parents. This experiment measured how well the child and parents
interact and communicate. While the child was initially learning the rules ofthe board game, the
parents were asked to discuss the "most important of the child issues identified in the [initial]
questionnaire" (Knutson et ai., 2005, p. 97). The second part of the session consisted of a roleplay scenario which tested the child's social problem solving skills (Knutson et ai., 2005). An
example of this task was having the parents and child preparing for a play-date with an
individual the child generally dislikes (Knutson et ai., 2005). The third part allowed the parents
and child time to freely interact with each other for ten minutes; the fourth part of the study
requested that the parents instruct the child to put all the toys away. All of these interactions were
recorded and analyzed by a "professional team of four behavior coders at Oregon Social
Learning Center (OSLC) using the Interpersonal Process Code" (Knutson et ai., 2005, p. 96).
Results ofthe study fell short in that the researchers were not able to establish an exact
connection between "neglectful parenting, poor supervision, and punitive parenting in the
development of children's aggression" (Knutson et ai., 2005, p. 92). "In short, [the] replicated
data suggest the addition of snpervisory and care are impOltant independent effects within
developmental models; however, much more work on neglectfhl parenting, harsh discipline, and
social disadvantage in the development of aggression is required" (Knutson et ai., 2005, p. 92).

Conduct disorder is a serious behavioral problem occasionally found in late childhood
and early adolescence; it is usually self serving and can even be violent behavior which the
individual does not see as wrong. The most common forms of conduct disorder are vandalism,
drug or alcohol use, manipulation, bullying, arson, and truancy (A.D.A.M. Medical
Encyclopedia, 2011). Lindon J. Eaves, Elizabeth C. Prom, and Judy L. Silberg (2010) researched
this phenomenon and its connection to the development of anti-social behavior when linked with
inter-parental violence, inconsistent parenting, and/or parental neglect. For tins study, researchers
gathered data on "childhood adversity, parental antisocial behavior, and longitudinal adult and
juvenile anti-social behavior" (Eaves et aI., 2010, p. 425) by assembling a study group which
consisted of 1,412 families with particular focus on families which contained adolescent twins.
By studying the anti-social behavior of both the parents and the children, Eaves et a1. (2010)
were able to conclude "the longitudinal study of twins and their parents makes it possible to
demonstrate there is a direct causal effect of childhood adversity on child conduct disorder over
and above any indirect genetic correlation" (p. 425).

Violence against Animals
While Jeffrey Dahmer adamantly denied ever hanning a living animal, it is well known
that he collected the bodies of dead animals and mutilated them in some rather extreme ways.
Heather Piper (2003) made an attempt to understand adolescent animal abuse by relating it to
interpersonal violence within the home. Theoretically, a child who was abused or neglected is
going to find an outlet for the frustration felt as a result of that abuse or neglect. That outlet can
take many forms, and according to Piper (2003), one possible outlet comes in the form of animal
abuse. Simply put "adults who are abusing animals are also likely to abuse their children and
[sic] children who abuse animals are also more likely to be victims of abuse" (Piper, 2003, p.

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

29

162). Piper (2003) even goes so far as to suggest that animal abuse may be an indicator of child
abuse or domestic violence within a family. However, Piper (2003) strongly encourages
individuals to not let their preconceived notions interfere with the true causes of animal abuse.
While media sources like to portray animal abuse as the gateway to serial murder, one must
understand that not every animal abuser is in a violent or abusive home nor is every animal
abuser fated to become a serial killer. Piper (2003) goes on to argue that most stndies on animal
abuse and later violence against humans suffer from "fundamental fallacies of logic" (Piper,
2003, p. 165) since there is no real proof that animal abuse will lead to homicidal tendencies later
in life. Many research studies which focus on this phenomenon target very specific populations,
such as criminals or serial killers, and do not account for the large nnmbers of children who
abnse animals and grow up normal. Piper (2003) suggests that a better definition of animal abuse
may help clarify the nature of the abuser. For example: In China, dogs and cats are regularly
killed and eaten and it is not seen as abnormal. The social stigmas associated with various forms
of animal abuse are going to change based on the individual, the location, and even the animal
being abused.
A child who grows up witnessing interpersonal violence between his or her parents will
often replicate the violence as a show of frustration or because it is something seen by the child
as normal. In a long term Italian study conducted by researcher Anna C. Baldry (2003), the
association between the witnessing of parental domestic violence and OCCUITence of animal abuse
perpetrated by the child witness was analyzed. According to the American Psychological
Association, children who are exposed to domestic violence will often act out in ways similar to
children who have experienced some form of abuse (Baldry, 2003). Animal abuse is frequently
regarded as a form of anti-social behavior and as a severe form of conduct disorder, both of

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

30

which are commonly associated with child abuse (Baldry, 2003). In order to test her theories
regarding tltis phenomenon, Baldry (2003) obtained parental permission to evaluate 1,392 Italian
youths in regards to domestic violence and animal abuse. These participants ranged in age from 9
to 17 years of age and were "45.9% girls and 54.1 % boys" (Baldry, 2003, p. 259, 263). The
pm1icipants were recruited fro11113 different schools, four elementary (28.5%), six middle
(47.3%), and three high schools (24.1%) in and around the province of Rome (Baldry, 2003). In
an effort to obtain relevant information on the participants, each individual was asked to reveal
the number and species of pets within the household. Socioeconomic status was another aspect
of interest in this stndy and was obtained by asking the participants about their parents' jobs,
their house size, the number of residents living within the home, and the district in wltich the
residence resided (Baldry, 2003). Animal abuse was measured using the P.E.T. (Physical and
Emotional Tormenting against Animals) Scale for preadolescents and adolescents (Baldry,
2003). This test analyzed both the child's experiences with animal abuse and the occasions when
the child witnessed animal abuse by a family member or peer. Animal abuse was determined to
be most prevalent among boys (66.5%) who witnessed animal abuse, while girls (33.5%) were
more likely to internalize the trauma in the form of depression or victimization as school (Baldry,
2003). Domestic violence was measured through a modified version ofthe Conflict Tactic Scale
which was adapted for youth participants (Baldry, 2003). The scale examined physical, verbal,
and emotional abuse with particular focus on father against mother and mother against father
domestic violence (Baldry, 2003). Baldry (2003) concluded the study by stating the results were
strongly supportive of the cOlmection between domestically violent homes and pm1icipants who
where abusive toward animals. As with many similarly focused studies (Piper, 2003; Dadds,
Whiting, & Hawes, 2006), Baldry (2003) encouraged individuals to not assume interpersonal

violence and animal abnse is automatically going to turn a child into a violent criminal as an
adult.
There are very few childhood behavioral problems that carry with them the ominous
nature and stereotyping commonly found among children who have abused animals (Dadds et
aI., 2006). Often times, children who abuse animals will be looked upon as violent future
criminals. Dadds et al. (2006) stepped forward to stonewall this misconception by looking deeper
into the phenomenon of childhood violence against animals. In order to effectively examine the
relationships between animal abuse and adult violent behavior, Dadds et al. (2006) chose to look
at this issue according to two primary factors. The first ofthese factors was the possibility of
animal abuse being the warning sign for a child who is a risk for developing psychopathic
tendencies (Dadds et aI., 2006). The second factor focuses on family problems as the source of
the conflict (Dadds et aI., 2006). Dadds et al. (2006) performed a research study by obtaining 131
pmiicipants fi'om five schools in Queensland, Australia; the students ranged in age fi'om 6 to 13
years of age and consisted of 67 males and 64 females. Data was obtained tlu'ough selfadministered questiOimaires which the participants were asked to return using the provided return
envelope. Using the Children and Animals Inventory, researchers were able to classify the
degree of animal cruelty based on nine dimensions of cruelty. The nine dimensions of cruelty
consisted of: severity or degree of pain inflicted upon the animal, frequency of the animal abuse,
duration or average time spent abusing the animal in one session, when the last act of abuse was
committed (recency), diversity of animals abused (example: dogs, cats, birds ... ), level of
concern for the abused animal (sentience), whether the child attempts to hide the act
(covertness), whether the act was committed alone or with others (isolation), and whether the
child regrets the acts of abuse(empathy) (Dadds et aI., 2006). Additionally, the child's

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

32

externalization was tested using the Child Behavior Checklist-Revised-Parent Form, the child's
potential for psychopathic behavior was tested using the Antisocial Process Screening Device,
and family conflict was measured by the conflict subscale of the Family Environment Scale
(Dadds et ai., 2006). As a result of these tests, Dadds et ai. (2006) not only concluded that male
children were more likely to engage in animal cruelty than females but that there is also a high
correlation between psychopathic behavior and animal cruelty. Dadds et ai. (2006) also strongly
sUPPOlied future studies which may be able to further understand the cOlmections between these
variables and provide information which could be used as an early warning system for troubled
children.
After numerous studies had shown a significant correlation between animal abuse and
domestic violence, many individuals felt it was time this data was implemented as a preventative
method. Using a study sample of 860 college students, Sarah DeGue and David DiLillo (2009)
attempted to show why many U.S. jurisdictions have chosen to adopt legislation which would
allow "child and animal welfare investigators to refer families with substantiated child
maltreatment or animal cruelty for investigation by parallel agencies" (DeGue & Delillo, 2009,
p. 1036). Over the years, there have been numerous studies conducted on victims of domestic
violence, child maltreatment, and child neglect (Dadds et ai., 2006; Baldry, 2003; Piper, 2003;
Trickette et ai.,2011; Mustanoja et ai., 2011; Sousa et ai., 2011; Kotch et ai., 2008; Maguire-Jack
et ai., 2012; Felson & Lane, 2009; LaBrode, 2007), and the vast majority of these studies have
shown a correlation between these cases and reports of animal abuse.
In many homes, animals are considered another member ofthe family, and as a result,
they are vulnerable to domestic violence, maltreatment, and/or neglect (DeGue & Delillo, 2009).
The student participants from DeGue and Delillo's (2009) study were obtained from three

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

33

universities across the Midwest and west, California, Nebraska, and Ohio, were 75.6% female,
70% white, and had an average age of20.1 years. Demographic and retrospective repol1s of child
maltreatment and domestic violence within the participant's family of origin were obtained using
the Computer-Assisted Maltreatment Inventory (DeGue & Delillo, 2009). This test allows
researchers to obtain a more accurate repol1 of each participant's childhood "sexual abuse,
physical abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic violence" (DeGue &
Delillo, 2009, p. 1043). The respondent's experience(s) with violence against animals was tested
using a modified version of Boat's (1999) Inventory on Animal-Related Experiences, known as
the Animal Violence Inventory (AVI) (DeGue & Delillo, 2009). Excluding hunting and routine
farm activities, DeGue and Delillo (2009) defined animal abuselneglect as denial of the basic
necessities (food, water, medical treatment, excessive confinement, and cleanliness) or the
intentional infliction of pain or injury (beating, fighting, and engaging in sexual acts with the
animal) on any domesticated or wild animal. Conclusions derived from this data showed that
approximately 57.9% of participants who witnessed or participated in animal clUelty as a child
were also exposed to child maltreatment andlor domestic violence as a child (DeGue & Delillo,
2009).

Serial Murder and/ol' Violence
Throughout history, there have been serial killers. Often times, these individuals are
morphed into monsters or creatures to better explain their actions, vampires for example, and
other times they are merely psychopathic individuals who have infiltrated one's society,
unidentified and fulfilling a need that even they may not fully understand. According to
numerous research studies, these monsters andlor psychopathic individuals have been victims of
abuse, witnesses to inter-parental violence, and perpetrators of animal abuse andlor mutilation. A

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

34

serial killer is by definition someone who has committed three or more murders of people
previously unknown to the individual with a "cooling off" period in between the murders
(Haggerty, 2009). This definition leaves much to the imagination and occasionally fails to
include dictators who order the murders oflarge numbers of individuals, operate death camps,
andlor oversee death marches (Haggerty, 2009). According to Haggerty (2009), this is a
significant flaw which has made researching serial murderers a challenging subject.
Haggeliy (2009) explained the role bureaucracy plays in modern serial murder by
underlying several modern phenomena connected to modern serial murders. The first of these
phenomena is mass media and the resulting celebrity culture. For example, Casey Anthony, OJ
Simpson, and numerous others have paved the way for countless individuals to reach celebrity
status tlu'ough alleged criminal acts within today's modern society (Haggerty, 2009). Since serial
murder is still a relatively rare occurrence within our society, mass media has only recently
begun to playa significant role in exploiting the enigma that is serial murder. Today,
mesmerized individuals can satisfy their need for tales of serial murder through countless true
crime and detective novels, movies and police dramas, and even in comic books and serial killer
collector cards (Haggerty, 2009). Jeffrey Dahmer, himself, is memorialized in modern society
with his own action figure, collector cards, movies, a comic strip, and other memorabilia (Jarvis,
2007).
The second phenomenon which aids in modern serial murder is the realization that we are
a society of strangers. In generations past, neighbors were very close and often times knew in
depth information about each other, each other's family, and personal predilections which offered
a significant amount of protection against serial killings, also known as stranger killings
(Haggerty, 2009). Often associated with a period of enlightenment which strongly focuses on

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

35

scientitic thought and reason, modern culture has led to a society which can rationalize dark
thoughts of murder and even genocide (Haggeliy, 2009). For example, Hitler's Germany was
able to rationalize the mass genocide of millions because they felt it was for the best, a means to
an end, and better yet, a way to remove the weak from society (Haggerty, 2009).
Following the rationale of Hitler's mass genocide against those who did not meet his
patiicular standard of humanity, society has fueled a generation of serial killers who are able to
rationalize their murders by dehumanizing their victims. For example: Jolm Wayne Gacy J1'. did
not refer to his victims as humans but instead as "wolihless little punks and queers" (Hhiler,
2011). Modern society has also assisted in the stereotyping of vulnerable victims. Current
statistics show that women in particular are affected by this phenomenon as women currently
account for sixty percent of serial killer victims (Haggerty, 2009). While serial murder is far
from being a novel concept, the advancements of modern society have only aided in making
serial murders more mainstream and profitable.
In today's society, individuals do not need to look far in order to find some SOli of serial
killer memorabilia, glorification, or even glamorization. Murder, violence, and blood are hot
conlll0dities which draw the attention of countless individuals around the world. Jarvis (2007)
explored this phenomenon and researched the impact it has on the serial consumer. Beginning
with the manner in which violent crime is marketed, Jarvis (2007) refers to serial murder as a
spectacle to be consumed by a society which craves violence. Ultimately, this article attempted
to uncover the "less transparent links between the normal desires which circulate within
consumer society and monstrous violence" (Jarvis, 2007, p. 326). While Hollywood has their
share of serial killing villains (vampires, zombies, Freddy Krueger, ect), the real world of serial
killers has made actions figures, comic books, t-shirts, and even trading cards for some of the

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

36

most famous real life serial killers in history, including "superstars" Ted Bundy, John Wayne
Gacy Jr., and Jeffrey Dahmer (Jarvis, 2007). Jarvis (2007) claimed individuals Hock to serial
murder because ofthe way serial killers can blend into a crowd, becoming unknown and deadly.
After analyzing numerous Hollywood serial killer movies, Jarvis (2007) was able to reveal that
most movies which revolve around a serial killer tend to be focused on either mass consumerism
(Campbell's soup in the Movie Seven or personal fitness in American Psycho) or the style of
murder (Jeffrey Dahmer and his cannibalism, Ted Bundy and his manipulation of good
Samaritans, John Wayne Gacy Jr. and his fascination with clowns and young boys and men)
(Jarvis, 2007).
Whether made into celebrities or not, serial killers are detrimental to society. Conduct
disorder accounts for numerous adolescent behaviors found to be socially offensive or
destructive to modern society and have often been cOlmected to later, more serious offenses. In
the Stephen D. Singer and Christopher Hensley (2004) analysis of one well known form of
conduct disorder and its cOlmection with later serial murders, children with a predilection for fire
starting were observed under the scope of the social learning theory. According to the social
learning theory, serial murder is a trait learned through personal experiences and the individual's
response to said experiences (Singer & Hensley, 2004). Often times, these experiences are
humiliating to the individual or provoke a high amount of frustration in the individual. In Jeffrey
Dahmer's case, he experienced vast amounts of neglect fi'om his parents as a child, and it is
theorized that he internalized the behavior by acting out (conduct disorder) which later evolved
into an anti-social and psychopathic behavior as he got older. Singer and Hensley (2004)
explained that the resulting frustration may even result in the individual's later victim choice.
Ted Bundy displayed a tendency to focus on specific traits in his victims by only killing women

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

37

who resembled a young woman who ended a relationship with him in college (Biography, 2012).
Data for the Singer and Hensley (2004) case study was obtained by studying the lives oftlU'ee
notorious serial killers who also had a history of fire starting; the serial killers were Carl
Panzram, Ottis Toole, and David Berkowitz (also known as Son of Sam). Through detailed
examinations of the individuals' lives, Singer and Hensley (2004) were able to reveal a strong
correlation between the abuse, humiliation, and neglect experienced by these individuals as
children and how those experiences may have resulted in their later fascination with arson and
serial murders.
Despite an international fascination with serial murders, there are still relatively few
studies or organizations with an agreed upon definition of who or what constitutes as serial
murder. In the study by William B. Arndt, Tammy Hietpas, and Juhu Kim (2004), patiicular
effort was made to define the characteristics of male serial murderers, their crimes, their victims,
and any additional information found to be relevant to the study. These efforts resulted in a
collection of definitions pertaining to male serial murder ranging from very basic to very specific
in nature (Amdt et aI., 2004). For Amdt et aI.'s (2004) study, 285 individual cases were
reviewed. In order to be considered for Arndt et aI. 's (2004) study group, the cases had to meet
the requirements ofthree or more murder victims committed by a male, had to be within the
United States during the 1900s, and the murders needed to be committed separately over a time
period of hours to years. Once these 285 individual cases were accepted into the study, they were
further classified according to the motivation of their suspects' victims: whether the killings were
sexually motivated or non-sexually motivated, whether the suspects were geographically stable
or transient during the murders, and finally whether the suspect(s) was killing within a team or
individually (Arndt et aI., 2004). Results of the examination by Arndt et aI. (2004) revealed

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

38

nearly half of serial murders are sexually motivated killings (48%), and 60% of the research
cases pertained to geographically stable individuals which were found to have a killing career
half the length of a transient killer. Only 16% of the suspects worked as a team, and while most
of the study suspects targeted female victims, those who targeted men generally had a higher
victim count (Arndt et aI., 2004). Additional conclusions put the average starting age to be
around 26 years of age with the majority of the suspects being White, followed by African
American (16%) (Arndt et aI., 2004). Hispanic and Asian suspects were found to be poorly
represented within the study; Arndt et al. (2004) suggested that additional research studies should
be implemented to study these two groups.
In 2005, researchers Willem H. J. Martens and George B. Palermo concluded a study on
loneliness; researching the impact it may have on the development of violent and/or anti-social
behaviors or attitudes. Focusing on serial killers, Dennis Nilsen and Jeffrey Dahmer in particular,
Martin and Palermo (2005) chose their target population based on the amount of loneliness the
individuals experienced while growing up. In the case of Jeffrey Dahmer, he was neglected by
his parents for most of his life, and as a result he was always looking for ways to keep himself
from being alone (Martin & Palermo, 2005). Jeffrey Dahmer's father neglected his son to finish
a PhD in chemistry, and Jeffrey Dahmer's mother was a drug addict who had little time for him
(Martin & Palermo, 2005). When his younger brother was born, the minimal attention Jeffrey
Dahmer received from his parents became even harder to obtain. Following his parents' divorce
when he was 18 years of age, his mother promptly took his brother and abandoned him to live
alone in his parents' old home (DaImler, 1994). After his mother's abandonment, Jeffrey Dahmer
sought to satisfy his need for company by seeking out young attmctive boys and men, drugging

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

39

them, having sex with them, and ultimately murdering, dismembering, and sodomizing their
bodies.
Martin and Palermo's (2005) second serial killer analysis focused on Demlis Nilsen.
Dennis Nilsen was the child of a Norwegian soldier who was rarely around and a Scottish mother
who showed little to no interest in her son; as a child, he was unable to develop a close bond with
either parent. The only individual he was able to form an emotional bond with was his
grandfather who died suddenly when Dennis Nilsen was only 6 years old (Mmiin & Palermo,
2005). Following his parents' divorce and his mother's remarriage when he was 8 years old,
Dennis Nilsen found himself pushed into the background by his mother who was now more
interested in her new family (Mmiin & Palermo, 2005).
From similarities between Jeffrey Dahmer and Dennis Nilsen, Mmiin and Palermo (2005)
were able to conclude that loneliness can have a significant impact on anti-social and homicidal
behaviors. According to Mmiin and Palermo (2005), this extreme loneliness may lead to
"internal rigidity, social-emotional and moral numbing, indifference, hostility, and anger" (p.
305). However, the authors also argue that an individual can be helped if those around the
individual know what warning signs to look for. "Substance abuse; depression; social-emotional
incapacities; lack of social suppOli and guidance; a violent, criminal, or indifferent environment;
and a lack of self-esteem are all warning signs of loneliness that individuals who works with or
around juveniles should be watching for" (Mmiin & Palermo, 2005, p. 306).

Chapter Summary
Childhood is one of the most influential stages of an individual's development, and by
exposing a child to violence and/or neglect, one may be inevitably impacting the development of

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

40

a child's self image or the image of those with which the child interacts. In this chapter, the
author has reviewed numerous articles on the social learning theory, childhood abuse and
neglect, anti-social behavior, violence against animals, and finally serial murder andlor violence.
Through these reviews, significant evidence has been presented which shows the impact abuse
andlor neglect can have on one's psychological development. Individuals who were abused,
neglected, andlor exposed to violence as a child were found to be at an increased risk for
personality disorders andlor criminal behaviors, including animal abuse and even serial homicide
(DeGue & Delillo, 2009; Dadds et aI., 2006; Baldry, 2003; Piper, 2003; Trickette et aI.,2011;
Mustanoja et aI., 2011; Sousa et aI., 2011; Kotch et aI., 2008; Maguire-Jack et aI., 2012; Felson
& Lane, 2009; LaBrode, 2007). Bandura's (1977) social learning theory was also reviewed in

order to add validity to the claim that a child's social and family environment may have a
considerable impact on the child's psychological development.

Method
Introduction
The case study will focus on the neglect and abuse suffered by Jeffrey Dahmer
throughout his childhood but will also provide theories which may account for his adult serial
murders. Using available qualitative data on the social learning theory, serial homicide, animal
and childhood abuse and neglect, interviews with Jeffrey Dahmer prior to his death, and
interviews with professionals in the field of child development, the author intends to shed light
on the potential consequences of childhood neglect and abuse. This case study was reviewed and
approved by the Regis University Institutional Review Board (IRB) as an exempt study on
October 10,2012. The IRB approved this case study under the exempt category
45CFR46.l01.b(4) and as IRB #12-299. This chapter is organized into four subsections: (1)
subject selection, (2) instrumentation, (3) data collection, (4) data analysis.

Subject Selection
Jeffrey Dahmer was chosen as the target population ofthis case study because he came
from a family without physical or sexual abuse, yet he still became one of America's most
notorious serial killers. Born May 21,1960, Jeffrey Dahmer was the first child born to Lionel
and Joyce Dahmer and would remain the only child until his younger brother, David, was born
December 1966 (Dahmer, 1994). For most of Jeffrey Dahmer's young life, his Father was a
graduate student working full time in order to finish his PhD in chemistry and had little time to
spare with his son. Joyce Dahmer was frequently plagued with mental health problems combined
with an addiction to anti-anxiety drugs. Consequentially, neither parent had much time to

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

42

dedicate to the development of young Jeffrey Dahmer and to steer him away from an obsession
with death. Neglect was a way of life for Jeffrey Dahmer. Ifhe had a problem, he intemalized it
because he knew his family could never spare the time to uncover the dark secrets which festered
within his mind.
What makes Jeffrey Dahmer different from other serial killers is that he grew up without
physical, verbal, or sexual abuse, and he did not have any severe health issues (other than a
double hemia surgery when he was approximately four years of age). However, he was subjected
to neglect and emotional abuse, both of which are commonly found among children in today's
society. With single and dual working parents becoming a normal occurrence in modem
families, many children are being exposed to much ofthe same abuse experienced by Jeffrey
Dalnner, yet very few ofthese children grow up to become violent or homicidal as adults.

Instrumentation
This analysis will not be integrating a large research group but will instead be
interviewing several professionals in the field of child development andlor psychology. In order
to reduce the amount of preconceived notions when it comes to the nature of serial killers, the
interviewed individuals will not be informed of the true focus of this analysis until after they
have completed four of the five questions. This precaution is to ensure the interviewee will not
let a preconceived stance toward the origin of serial killers influence the answers to the
questiomlaire. The questions are asked in an open-ended style, and the interviewees are
encouraged to answer to the best of their knowledge.
The first question in the questionnaire asks: "In your opinion, is psychopathic or
antisocial behavior learned through life experiences (bullying, neglect, abuse ... ) or is an

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

43

individual born with these tendencies" (Appendix A)? This question will help determine whether
the patticipant believes violent crimes to be a result of an individual's biological or genetic
make-up (nature) or as a result of the environment in which they were raised (nurture). The
second question asks palticipants: "How much of an impact do you believe adolescent
abuse/neglect would have on the development of psychopathic or antisocial tendencies"
(Appendix A)? Third, the patticipant is asked: "What type(s) of child or adolescent abuse/neglect
do you believe would have the most significant impact on adult violence (Physical, Sexual,
Emotional, or Neglect)" (Appendix A)? Questions two and three are to determine the
interviewee's stance on abuse and neglect and how it may influence later, violent behavior. The
fourth question asks: How likely do you think an abused child would be to project this violence
on to another person or animal? Explain" (Appendix A)? This question reveals the interviewee's
stance on the relationship between child abuse/neglect and animal cruelty. Once the first four
questions have been asked, the interviewee is then informed that tllis study pertains to serial
murder and Jeffrey Dahmer in patticular. The fifth question is the only question which directly
asks questions about Jeffrey Dahmer, and it is as follows: "Jeffrey Dahmer experienced neglect
and emotional abuse as a child. How much of an impact do you believe this abuse had on his
behavior and eventual murders of 17 young men" (Appendix A)?

Data Collection
According to Babbie (2010), when examining a social phenomenon which is documented
by media sources (newspaper, magazines ... ), an unobtrusive research method is the most
effective method for data collection. In tllis case study, data will be obtained through the review
or content analysis "of human communication" (Babbie, 2010, p. 320). The abuse and neglect
experienced by Jeffrey Dahmer as a child is a primary focus in this case study and will,

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

44

therefore, be critically analyzed and compared to numerous studies conducted on abuse, neglect,
animal cruelty, and serial killers in general. Data gathered over the course of this case study will
consist primarily of qualitative research that has been conducted on Jeffrey Dahmer's life
(interviews, biographies ... ) and on abuse/neglect (websites, organizations, government
sources ... ). For information pertaining directly to Jeffrey Dahmer, the majority of the
information will be coming from the biography, A Father's StOlY, written by Jeffrey Dahmer's
father, Lionel Dahmer, and from publicly available interviews with Jeffrey DaInner. The
interviews will provide information on his life, his state of mind, and reactions from those who
knew him. Secondary sources on the social learning theory, child abuse and neglect, serial
killers, and animal cruelty were obtained from journal articles, government atticles, online
databases, and organizations which specialize in abused and/or neglected children. Primary
sources were obtained from firsthand interviews with the target population, which in this case
study will consist of the interviews with Jeffrey Dahmer. Additional primary sources will consist
of interviews with individuals who specialize in child development, intervention, and addictive
behavior.
Chapter Summary
While this case study aimed to expose the long term impacts of child abuse and neglect in
the American serial killer, Jeffrey Dahmer, this chapter focused on the methodology which was
used within this case study. One of the first things the author did was explain why Jeffrey
Dahmer and his experiences with domestic violence, abuse, and neglect were chosen as the focus
ofthis case study. The author also used this chapter to explain which sources were most
beneficial to this study and why. Additionally, the author used an open ended survey to obtain
additional information and points of view from professionals within the field of child

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

45

development, intervention, and rehabilitation. The survey and the logic behind each of the survey
questions was discussed within this chapter; however, the results of the surveys and collected
data will be analyzed in chapter four.

Data Analysis
Introduction
Data or content Analysis is the "study of recorded human communication" (Babbie,
2010, p. 320). As previously mentioned in this case study, data found valid and pertinent to this
study was obtained throughjournal articles, newspaper clippings, biographies, interviews, and
numerous federal and private organizations. After each source had been read and critically
analyzed, the obtained information was written in a brief outline fOlm which made the
information easier to find should it be needed for additional analysis at a later point. Once the
study outline was constmcted, the author constructed supplementary questions which the author
considered valid to this case study's primary focus. These supplementary questions can be found
in appendix A.
Government and Private Organizations, such as Child Welfare (2008a, 2008b, & 2009),
The Center for Disease Control (2012), and Victims of Violence (20lla & 2011 b) were of great
assistance when attempting to understand the inner workings of abused andlor neglected
children. These sources were able to add valuable statistical and firsthand knowledge of children
who, like Jeffrey Dahmer, developed anti-social and psychopathic tendencies as a result of
childhood abuse and neglect. The sources were also of particular value when reviewing the
impact of a child witnessing domestic violence andlor heated arguments between parents or
responsible caregivers. Similar to children who experience abuse and neglect, children who
witness inter-parental violence or arguments are at a higher risk of developing psychological,

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

47

developmental, and behavioral difficulties (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2009;
Mustanoja et aI., 2011; Sousa et aI., 2011; Kotch et aI., 2008).
Interviews
Interviews and biographies about the life of Jeffrey Dahmer were invaluable in this study
since there was no way to directly interview Jeffrey Dahmer following his murder by a fellow
inmate in 1994. The interviews questioned Jeffrey Dahmer's motivations for murder,
cannibalism, and necrophilia and revealed both startling and heartbreaking revelations fi'om
Jeffrey Dahmer and both his parents. By watching and analyzing the interview by Stone Phillips
of Jeffrey Dahmer, the author was able to get Jeffrey Dahmer's view on the biography written by
his Father as well as the opinion of Jeffrey Dahmer's Mother, an insight into Jeffrey Dahmer's
life that is not very easy to find.
The interviews conducted by the author for this case study were also helpful in
understanding the impacts of child abuse/neglect, animal cruelty, and how those incidents
influence child development leading into adulthood. The first of the paliicipating respondents
was Gopa Ka Ross (2012), an expeli in child intervention and art education. Ross (2012)
received her Bachelor's degree in Art education, her Master's degree in Art Education with an
emphasis in 31i therapy, and she is a certified Early Childhood SpecialistlInterventionist.
Additionally, Ross (2012) specializes in children age 0 (pregnancy) to 6 years of age.
With over 35 years of experience in this field, Ross's (2012) immediate response to the
question regarding the development of psychopathic or anti-social behavior was to state that
children can be born with these issues as well as develop them through life experiences.
Additionally, Ross (2012) explained that anti-social and psychopathic behavior can be

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

48

genetically inherited from the individual's parents. These tendencies are often times undiagnosed
and may not even be diagnosable due to our current knowledge of and the mysteries sUll'ounding
the human brain. However, Ross (2012) stated that these inherited tendencies can be treated with
"proactive pro-social intervention by caring parents, teachers, or therapists" (Appendix B). These
children may still need medication to make up for issues untreatable by intervention methods,
but given time, they should be able to develop positive functional interactions with others (Ross,
2012).
In regard to adolescent abuse/neglect and its impact on the development of anti-social or
psychopathic tendencies, Ross (2012) stated that while abuse/neglect could have a negative
impact on adolescent aged children, abuse/neglect would have a more significant impact on
children during their early years. Through Ross's (2012) 35+ years of experiences, sexual abuse
is the one form of abuse that she has never seen fail to manifest itself in one form or another.
However, Ross (2012) also claims that both physical and sexual abuse can be connected with
higher levels of adult aggression or violence. Emotional abuse is what Ross (2012) referred to as
the "ghost in the nursery" (Appendix B). The' ghost' is often associated with neglect, a loss of
self-esteem, emotionally violent outbursts, and manifestations of unadulterated rage as a teen
(Ross, 2012). Jeffrey Dahmer internalized these traits until his teen years when he displayed the
'ghost' by dissecting animals around 15 years old; these violent outbursts would transfer to
humans when he was 18 years old.
Building on the "ghost in the nursery" reference, Ross (2012) responded to the question
of childhood abuse and its potential projection on to another person or animal by stating
"children with a history of abuse/neglect do repeat the abusive acts they experienced" (Appendix
B). Sometimes, however, this violence against other people or animals is seen as a way to

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

49

retaliate or express their anger/frustration for the abuse and mistreatment that they have
experienced (Ross, 2012). Confusion is another element of this transference of rage and
frustration, as the children become old enough to realize that someone should have been there to
protect them and/or take care of them (Ross, 2012). Abused/neglected children are, therefore,
likely to hurt, bully, and/or abuse others as a way to vent the frustration they feel for their
suffering (Ross, 2012). When asked how this abuse and neglect may have influenced Jeffrey
Dahmer, Ross (2012) admitted to knowing very little about Jeffrey Daluner and his crimes. In
order to avoid adding a bias point of view, the author has chosen to remove any and all
discussion between the author and Ross (2012) which pertained to Jeffrey Dahmer.
The second participant was Robert Gregg (2012) who specializes in the drug and alcohol
counseling of adult offenders. Gregg (2012) has worked in the counseling field for 34 years;
previously he worked iu family counseling but is currently working as a drug and other addiction
counselor. Since we were unable to meet in person, this questionnaire was completed through
email. Any confusion regarding the questions in the questionnaire was sent directly to an email
attached to the author's cellular phone, where emails were promptly received and responded to.
When asked whether or not anti-social and psychopathic behavior is something an
individual is born with or learns through life experiences, Gregg (2012) stated that he believes
these behaviors to be learned. He defended this stance by explaining individuals who have
experienced abuse in the past are frequently found to abuse others (Gregg, 2012). This assCliion
has been confirmed by multiple research studies throughout the years (Child Welfare
Information Gateway, 2008a; Finkelhor et aI., 2009; Kotch et aI., 2008; Trickettet aI., 2011;
Victims of Violence, 2011a; Victims of Violence, 2011 b). When questioned about the impact of
adolescent abuse/neglect, Gregg (2012) responded by stating "adolescence is a critical time of

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

50

development ... any abuse or neglect could develop into psychopathic or antisocial tendencies"
(Appendix C). The third question on the questiOlmaire allowed Gregg (2012) to further define
childhood/adolescent abuse by asserting his belief that physical abuse or neglect results in a
higher degree of acting out in a violent manner.
When asked if a child's experience with abuse could resnlt in the projection of violence
on to other living creatures, Gregg (2012) stated that it would be very likely and referred to a
phenomenon known as the poisonous pedagogy. According to Alice Miller (N.D.) and Robert
Slagle (N.D.) this phenomenon is found in dysfunctional families whose parents belittle or
shame their children into repressing their emotions or behaviors which the parents find to be
offensive. Slagle's (N.D.) article claims "this wounding of the inner child [may later become] the
basis for compulsive/addictive behavior in adults" (Slagle, N.D., p. 1). This could explain Jeffrey
Dahmer's behaviors as an adult since his parents had little or no time set aside to spend with him
or help him develop a healthy self-esteem or self-worth. The emotional abuse and neglect at the
hands of his parents effectively stunted Jeffrey Dahmer emotional development, in that he
became unable to share his problems with his parents out offear of being a burden. Gregg (2012)
ultimately felt Jeffrey Dahmer's childhood emotional abuse and neglect were contributing
factors to his adult sadistic behavior; however, Gregg (2012) also felt that Jeffrey Dahmer was a
"volitional free-agent" who in the end chose to commit murder (Appendix C).

Organizations and Reseal'ell Studies
SimplyPsychology.org is a private organization which was found to be particularly useful
when researching Bandura's (1977) social learning theory, in which, "behavior is learned from
the environment through the process of observational learning" (McLeod, 2011, p. 1). Albert
Bandura's (1977) social learning theory, is a form of operant conditioning, in which an

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

51

individual's behavior can be changed based on positive, negative, or neutral reinforcement
(McLeod, 2007). Bandura's (1977) theory was used in this case study as a way to explain Jeffrey
Daimler's attitude toward his victims. Since Jeffrey Dahmer was neglected as a child, this may
be why he lacked empathy for his victims. Since his own parents did not value his well-being as
a child, it may have led to his inability to value the well-being of his victims. By comparing the
social learning theory to the information within the gathered atiicles and studies, it is believed
the resulting data will show a strong correlation between neglect/abuse and the possible (but not
guaranteed) development of psychopathic tendencies as an adult.
Following an extensive review of current literature on abuse, neglect, antisocial behavior,
serial killers, and the social learning theory, the key issues were compared to the author's theory
that some, but not all, children who have experienced abuse/neglect as a child are at an increased
risk of displaying antisocial or violent behavior as they grow into adulthood. After comparing
and contrasting the literature with the focal point of this case study, the author was able to
confirm that most research stndies do confirm that child neglect, abuse, and even the witnessing
of domestic violence will have an impact on child development and later criminal behavior.
There is, however, very little information to explain why some children appear to be impervious
to violence, abuse, and neglect as a child and appear to grow into socially acceptable adults. Ross
(2012) suggests that the reason some abused/neglected children still grow into contributors to
society is due to other caregivers providing the support and boundaries such children need as
they develop. This shows that as a society, researchers need to conduct further long term
research studies on this phenomenon. By increasing the general understanding of the
development of antisocial and psychopathic behavior in children and adults, we may be one step
closer to predicting and preventing future violent behavior by abused and neglected children.

Chapter Summary
After gathering all of the relevant data in previous chapters, this chapter's purpose was to
compile and analyze the results. Begimling with the published literature on Jeffrey Dahmer, child
abuse/neglect, antisocial behavior, animal abuse, and the social learning theOlY, the author was
able to gather conclusions and theories which bolstered the author's hypothesis that abuse and
neglect can have detrimental impacts on children and adolescents. The 1994 interview with
Jeffrey Dahmer was able to provide insight into why Jeffrey Dahmer murdered 17 young boys
and men. Additionally, the interview gave Lionel Dahmer and Joyce Flint's point of view about
Jeffrey Daluner as a child and adolescent, their marital disputes and how that may have impacted
Jeffrey Dahmer, and what they believe may have led their son to murder. The interview results,
with Ross (2012) and Gregg (2012), were analyzed. By answering the survey questions, Ross
(2012) and Gregg (2012) provided the viewpoint of two professionals, and their expert opinions
of the long term impacts of child abuse and neglect were presented and compared with literature
studies. The results of the data collection revealed several discrepancies and questions the author
feels warrant further study which will be discussed later in the next chapter.

Chapter 5
Results
This case study focused on Jeffrey Dahmer and the abuse and neglect he experienced as a
child. Using information obtained from various government and private organizations, websites,
interviews, and jonrnal articles, the anthor was able to conclnde that the abnse and neglect
experienced by Jeffrey Dahmer may very well have had a significant impact on his later actions
as a sexual serial killer. Through the criminological theOlY, known as the social learning theory,
the author was able to argue that Jeffrey Dahmer's experiences with abuse and neglect may have
led him to becoming one of America's most notorious serial killers. The social learning theory
suggests that Jeffrey Dahmer became homicidal because he was denied the child-parent
interactions which could have helped him obtain a healthy sense of social development. While
Jeffi-ey Dahmer's childhood abuse and neglect appears to be a common trend among serial
killers, it is not commonly found among children or adolescents who have experienced abuse
andlor neglect at a young age. However, the research obtained during this case study was not
entirely suppOllive of the author's hypothesis; existing research showed discrepancies and
provided valid arguments which the author feels are deserving of further research.

Suggestions for Future Study
As result ofthis exploratory case study, the author was confronted with several
inconsistencies in regards to the case study's hypothesis. The most significant of these
discrepancies was revealed during the interview with Ross (2012) when she stated that she
believed anti-social behavior could be inherited from an individual's parents. This was a
possibility which the author initially overlooked when creating the thesis statement before being

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

54

enlightened by not only Ross's (2012) statements but also the Stone Phillips interview with
Jeffrey Dahmer (Dalnnervideo, 1994). Piper (2003) clarified one common misconception in
regards to animal and child abuse when she stated that society has long been diluted into
believing children who abuse animals are doomed to become violent and disturbed individuals.
This belief is false as many children who abused animals at one point have still grown up to lead
normal and productive lives. Another discrepancy which became apparent during this case study
is the belief that adolescent abuse/neglect at a young age is going to have an equally significmlt
impact on the potential development of violent and/or aggressive behavior as the child ages
(Kotch et ai., 2008; Maguire-Jack et ai., 2012). This belief is also false. While there are some
children who become violent as a result of being abused or neglected, it is not a certain outcome.
Many children or adolescents who are abused do not become violent or aggressive. While none
of these inconsistencies are novel concepts, the author had not taken these ideas into account
when designing tins case study.
As a result of this case study, the author strongly believes that there are several questions
which need to be answered if society ever wants to fully understand the phenomenon of child
abuse/neglect and its impact on the development of violent behavior as an adult. The first of
these questions is why some abused or neglected children turn violent while others are perfectly
fine. Researchers need to study what environments, support systems, and other influential factors
help an abused or neglected child cope. Second, there needs to be research on child abuse/neglect
outside ofthe criminal population. Many of the studies found during research within this case
study focused primarily on individuals who have been arrested for violent behavior. Researchers
need to study abused individuals who have not been mTested and are from all socioeconomic

JEFFREY DAHMER: PSYCHOPATHY AND NEGLECT

55

statuses, races, demographics, etc .. By nanowing the research focus to criminals, the researchers
are limiting the study's potential, which may result in an important element being overlooked.
Chapter Summary
This chapter summarized the results of this exploratory case study and allowed the author
to conclude that child abuse and neglect can have an impact on later violent behavior. However,
this is not the case for all abused/neglect child and adolescents since many abuse/neglected
children and adolescents are able to live normal lives as they grow into adults. The author
discussed the need for further research in this field using the two main discrepancies found
within the case study.

Appendix A
Abused Child. Violent Adult?
1. In your opinion, is psychopathic or antisocial behavior learned through life experiences
(bullying, neglect, abuse ... ) or is an individual born with these tendencies?

2. How much of an impact do you believe adolescent abuse/neglect would have on the
development of psychopathic or antisocial tendencies?

3. What type(s) of child or adolescent abuse/neglect do you believe would have the most
significant impact on adult violence? (physical, Sexual, Emotional, or Neglect)

4. How likely do you think an abused child would be to project this violence on to another
person or animal? Explain?

Once the previous foul' questions have been answered I will then reveal that this paper is
focusing on Jeffrey Dahmer. It is believed that this will prevent the interviewee from being
influenced by what they know of Jeffrey Dahmer or other well lmown serialldllers.

5. Jeffrey Dahmer experienced neglect and emotional abuse as a child. How much of an
impact do you believe this abuse had on his behavior and eventual murders of 17 young
men?
